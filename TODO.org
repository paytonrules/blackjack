* Tests To write:
[x] Player Stands
[x] Rename computer hand to dealer hand
[x] Create a context with cards
[x] Dealer plays hand (stands on all 17)
[x] Player gets 21 on their hit (automatically plays to end)
[x] Fix Dealing order - you flubbed it
[x] Dealer gets natural blackjack - insta-lose player can't hit - better message / state?
[x] Player busts - dealer doesn't deal cards
[x] You lost a game with 21, how did that happen?
[x] Transition from win/lose/draw to next hand (new, shuffled deck)
[x] Better messages for player blackjack and dealer blackjack.

* Console UI
* Test Cleanup
[x] Fix all "unused" warnings, move functions that are only in tests to tests
* TODO Deal Two Hands on New Deal Button
** DONE Show the actual cards dealt
*** DONE Construct the resource name from the card type
*** DONE Deal the cards relative to each other (shifting to the 'right')
** DONE Show player and dealer hands
*** DONE Create a "hand" scene and place both on the screen, dealer on top, player on bottom
** DONE Hide the hidden card
** DONE REFACTOR!
*** DONE Extract functions for the duplicate code
*** DONE Reconsider naming (yet again)
*** DONE Test the code that calculates the position of the card
** DONE Get Command-line game working
*** DONE Create a workspace with godot separate from game lib
**** DONE Remove all gdnative from blackjack lib
**** DONE Point godot-blackjack at blackjack lib (in toml)
**** DONE Get godot-blackjack compiling

**** DONE Make main.old back into main.rs and see it running again
*** DONE Move godot code out of lib
** DONE Player Interaction
*** DONE Hit me!
** HOLD Extract a utility library for Godot
- I use a couple functions regularly and I think I want to make them a helper crate that I just always use. But they are probably not ready-for-prime-time yet.
** TODO Have the cards be "dealt" in
*** TODO Don't deal the next card until the previous is dealt! Async?
**** DONE Put the animation as a node in the scene
- Simply hide/show it.

***** DONE Run an animation for one card
***** DONE Pass the remaining list of cards to the animation functions
***** DONE Animate the next dealt card
***** DONE Animate to the right spot
***** DONE Animate dealing the hole card for the dealer
**** HOLD Maybe pull the script out and attach it to the card
**** DONE Maybe try Tweens instead of the animation player
***** DONE See if we can add rotation to the tween
***** DONE Sequential Tweens so they wait one at a time
****** In the case statement prepare the tweens rather than start them.
****** Store the list of "tweens to play"
****** Play the first tween, with "card dealt" as the signal to be called
****** On card dealt, deal the next card
***** DONE Delay so cards come one at a time?
** DONE Remove warnings for unused code
** TODO Remove duplication of state machines!
*** TODO Make sure you say when the player/dealer has blackjack (new action)
*** TODO Say when the dealer busts
*** DONE Showing the dealer hole card requires the context
** TODO Bug! Player can win by drawing 21, without dealers chance to tie.
** TODO Cleanup Result and Option types that just unwrap or expect
** HOLD Make winning text fun!
*** TODO Ditto New Game/etc buttons
**** TODO Refactor to use a UI node
**** TODO Get cool fonts
** HOLD Refactor game states to be ~mut self~ so they don't require cloning
** HOLD Make the felt look like ...felt
