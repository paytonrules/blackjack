* Tests To write:
[x] Player Stands
[x] Rename computer hand to dealer hand
[x] Create a context with cards
[x] Dealer plays hand (stands on all 17)
[x] Player gets 21 on their hit (automatically plays to end)
[x] Fix Dealing order - you flubbed it
[x] Dealer gets natural blackjack - insta-lose player can't hit - better message / state?
[x] Player busts - dealer doesn't deal cards
[x] You lost a game with 21, how did that happen?
[x] Transition from win/lose/draw to next hand (new, shuffled deck)
[x] Better messages for player blackjack and dealer blackjack.

* Console UI
* Test Cleanup
[x] Fix all "unuused" warnings, move functions that are only in tests to tests
* TODO Deal Two Hands on New Deal Button
** DONE Show the actual cards dealt
*** DONE Construct the resource name from the card type
*** DONE Deal the cards relative to each other (shifting to the 'right')
** DONE Show player and dealer hands
*** DONE Create a "hand" scene and place both on the screen, dealer on top, player on bottom
** DONE Hide the hidden card
** TODO REFACTOR!
*** TODO Extract functions for the duplicate code
*** TODO Reconsider naming (yet again)
*** TODO Test the code that calculates the position of the card
*** HOLD Move godot code out of lib
** TODO Get Command-line game working
*** TODO Create a workspace with godot separate from game lib
** HOLD Extract a utility library for Godot
- I use a couple functions regularly and I think I want to make them a helper crate that I just always use. But they are probably not ready-for-prime-time yet.
** TODO Refactor game states to be ~mut self~ so they don't require cloning
